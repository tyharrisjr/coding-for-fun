<h1>Chicken</h1>
<p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. 
Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.</p>

Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. 
A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.

Chicken can mean a chick, as in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where Macduff laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their dam".[15] 
The usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.[16] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, chickens as a 
species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.[17]
